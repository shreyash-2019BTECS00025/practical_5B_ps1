            <h2>Why Do You Need A Web Hosting?</h2>
            <p>The website files are required to be stored on a special computer called web server. The web server is a special robust computer system specially designed for renting storage space and other services for hosting the websites on the internet.
            Hosing a website on your own server is an expensive proposition. The web server is a special type of computer equipped with set of hardware and software. The web server also needs a very reliable power backup, precision air conditioning, technical staff to trouble shoot and to maintain the web server. And hence, it is a more practical and economical option to avail the hosting services offered by other companies rather than hosting the website on your own server. The hosting companies such as Bluehost, Godaddy, Siteground, Hostgator and other such web hosting companies are specialist in offering hosting packages.</p>
